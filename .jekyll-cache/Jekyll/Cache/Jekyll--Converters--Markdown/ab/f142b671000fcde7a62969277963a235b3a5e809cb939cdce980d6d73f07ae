<p>Welcome to Waypoint Ventures! Weâ€™re glad youâ€™ve joined our team.</p>

<p>Weâ€™ve found that people who fill Subject-Matter Expert (SME) Writer and Microlearning Specialist (MLS) roles typically have a smoother experience developing content if they understand their <a href="/onboard-docs/01-people/01-who-is-who.html">role on the development team</a>, including what we expect of them (and what we donâ€™t), and who else might be on their team. We think youâ€™ll find these materials helpful as you dig into Waypointâ€™s development process and your critical role in it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> This high-level onboarding material is oriented toward general content development. However, some of it specifically targets development of microlearning content.</p>
