## Hand off to PjM

Once all units of a module have an Acrolinx score of 80 or higher and pass all build-validation tests, the MLS hands off the module to the PjM, who then submits it to Microsoft for their publishing process:

1. The PjM adds “#sign-off” to the comments in the pull request.

    > Note: any words that are spelled correctly (such as terms) but were flagged as misspellings by Acrolinx are added to the pull request at this point. 

1. The pull request gets assigned to the appropriate Microsoft reviewer.
