## Create a module design

Creating a module’s design document, or *design doc* as we refer to it, is the first step in module development. A design doc should contain a high-level overview of all topics, exercises, and videos that the module will include. Additionally, a design doc should include specifics about the level (difficulty) of the material and expected audience; and then module scenarios, titles, learning objectives, prerequisites, structure of individual units, and descriptions of exercises. 

A design doc provides SMEs and Microlearning Specialists an opportunity to examine the flow of material, the timing of each component, and whether the content adequately addresses the prescribed learning objectives. 

Creating the Module design doc is the first step in module development. A design doc should contain:

- A high-level overview of all topics, exercises, and videos in a module.

- The level (difficulty) of material, audience, and prerequisites

- A module scenario, title, and the module learning objectives

- The unit structure

- Descriptions of the units and exercises.

A design doc gives a project’s Subject Matter Experts and Microlearning Specialists an opportunity to examine the flow of material and each component’s timing, to help determine whether the content adequately addresses the specified learning objectives.

>**Note:** An MLS often will assist a SME with creating a module’s design so that it fulfills our statement of work and meets requisite delivery standards.

SMEs must use the provided Microsoft Word template to create a module’s design doc, as it contains the required layout and content that Microsoft expects for microlearning modules. 

>**Note:** It’s imperative that you use headings and other Word paragraph styles that the template provides, as these are required for converting Word content to markdown. 

An approved, detailed Microsoft Word template will be provided to SMEs for use in creating a module’s design doc. It contains the correct layout and content that Microsoft expects for a Microlearning module. 

The template also contains comments that’ll help guide SMEs as they develop microlearning content, particularly with respect to adding the correct content in the proper format. It also contains links to pertinent articles about development and other topics in the <a href="https://review.docs.microsoft.com/help/learn/?branch=main" target="_blank">Microsoft Learn Contributor Guide ![external link](../assets/images/extlink.png)</a>.

>**Important!** A module’s design *must adhere* to the guidance from the <a href="https://review.docs.microsoft.com/help/learn/?branch=main" target="_blank">Microsoft Learn Contributor Guide ![external link](../assets/images/extlink.png)</a>. All SMEs and Microlearning Specialists must be familiar with the portions of the guide that apply to all content they create and edit. We recommend that you start by reading the content under <a href="https://review.docs.microsoft.com/help/learn/id-guidance?branch=main" target="_blank">Authoring Guidelines ![external link](../assets/images/extlink.png)</a> section.

## Module design reviews

There are three main review passes for a module’s design doc: the MLS review, the design Charette meeting for a customer review, and the copy-edit pass.

### MLS review of a module’s design

The MLS performs an instructional-design review on the module’s design to ensure that it aligns with the guidelines in the <a href="https://review.docs.microsoft.com/help/learn/?branch=main" target="_blank">Microsoft Learn Contributor Guide ![external link](../assets/images/extlink.png)</a>. They also ensure that the content flows well, that the units and modules all have timings that are appropriate, and that the material reflects the learning objectives specified. Additionally, after the MLS review:

- The SME reviews the tracked changes from the MLS review and leaves their own comments and tracked changes. The MLS resolves all comments and tracking.

- The customer reviews, and provides sign off for, the module design.

### Design Charette Meeting

To capture customer feedback, we use a Design Charette Meeting format for each module in the project, as follows:

1. The SME, PjM, MLS, and customer participants are all present at the meeting. 

2. A day before the meeting, the PjM sends participants (who the customer identifies) a link to the applicable module design doc. The document is written in Word, and is sent to the customer with Track Changes turned on. The PjM also sends “starter questions” to get participants ready for the meeting.

3. At the meeting, the SME thoroughly reviews the design with the team to clarify all pieces of it. The SME also fields questions and provides responses, and notates any conflicting information for further review. The MLS takes notes while also being alert for any comments or requests that might conflict with the <a href="https://review.docs.microsoft.com/help/learn/?branch=main" target="_blank">Microsoft Learn Contributor Guide ![external link](../assets/images/extlink.png)</a>. The PjM is alert for any requests or comments that are out of scope for the project’s SOW.

4. Typically, the SME incorporates requested changes, researches and resolves conflicting information, and then the MLS reviews and resolves those updates.

### Copy-edit pass of a module’s design

All of our design docs go through a full copy-edit pass prior to final sign off. The Copy Editor (CE) reviews the module designs for grammar, clarity, flow, and to determine if it meets style mandates set forth by Microsoft and MS Learn. The CE uses Word’s Track Changes functionality to indicate all recommend edits and inserts comments where applicable. The CE also runs the FindWords macro and Word’s Editor tool before submitted the edited design doc to the MLS for review and resolution. The MLS might ask for input from the SME for clarifications about comments, edits, or user-interface (UI) elements the copy editor asks about. The MLS resolves any remaining comments and changes.
