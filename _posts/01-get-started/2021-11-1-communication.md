Waypoint has guidelines to help you decide how best to communicate about project matters and milestones.

We recommend that you use:

- Email (use <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/office/outlook-training-8a5b816d-9052-4190-a5eb-494512343cca" target="_blank">the newest version of Outlook ![external link](../assets/images/extlink.png))</a> for communications of record, such as assignments, <a href="https://waypointventures.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/sites/Home/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B780B3B73-6779-4D8E-A506-0BA3B1372DE5%7D&file=Waypoint%20Hand-off%20Foundations.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true" target="_blank">hand-offs ![external link](../assets/images/extlink.png)</a>, sign-offs, and similar communication. Email is the most reliable communication method for threads and information that we want to retain within a project record.

Do you need a question answered or a point clarified? A Teams chat message is essentially an instant message (IM) that’s useful for information conversations.
- <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/office/work-in-channels-99d33aaa-0743-47c6-a476-eb0a24abcb7e" target="_blank">Teams channel ![external link](../assets/images/extlink.png)</a> conversations for projects. You’ll typically use a specific Teams site’s General channel and conduct your conversation there. Channel conversations are great for sharing concepts and ideas, and for team-wide messaging, kind of like a whole-team chat session. Again, if you want to draw the attention of a specific person or persons, tag them.

    >**Tip:** When starting a Teams chat or channel conversation, tag the person you’re trying to reach to alert them that they have a chat waiting. To tag a person, in the chat field, enter the @ symbol and then the first few letters of their name. Select their name when it appears. When you've been tagged, a red number will appear over the **Activity** bell icon in the Teams sidebar.

    >**Tip:** Create all meetings in Outlook, and use the <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-the-scheduling-assistant-and-room-finder-for-meetings-in-outlook-2e00ac07-cef1-47c8-9b99-77372434d3fa" target="_blank">Scheduling Assistant ![external link](../assets/images/extlink.png)</a> and other Outlook tools to ensure those people who need to be at your meeting are available. Be sure to select the **Teams Meeting** button on the ribbon. It generates a Teams meeting link that appears in the meeting-invite email, so you and other participants can select it and join the meeting in Teams.

### Microsoft Corpnet credentials

For many Waypoint projects, you’ll receive Microsoft corporate network (Corpnet) credentials. This is a Microsoft email address and password. We refer to these credentials as a *vdash* because the first two characters in the email address are a *v* and a dash (*-*), such as v-johndoe@microsoft.com. The “v” signifies that you’re a Microsoft vendor.

You’ll use your Corpnet credentials to access restricted Microsoft resources. You can also use your Corpnet credentials and Azure Virtual Desktop (called Remote Desktop on your computer) to access a complete Office 365 environment, including Outlook, Teams, and Microsoft Office.
