Toward the end of our development phase, when compliance testing needs to occur (and before a module can publish), the Microlearning Specialist (MLS) converts a module Microsoft Word document into separate markdown files (one for each unit) and moves them into the GitHub environment.

Markdown is a markup language that you can use to create web content in a simple word-processing format and then easily convert it to web content in HTML. Itâ€™s similar to HTML but much easier for most people to use, and we do, in many of our courses in the GitHub and Azure DevOps environments.
